# Cve-Fox 

**Light WebApplication to download the latest CVE information from the NIST and gain insight into it.**

Uses full text searching on the information provided from the nist and uses a custom algorithm to rate the chance of a CVE being relevant to the given organisation based on word matching in the description.

Comes with a simple web interface which revolves around simplicity and usability, the goal is to have a interface which allows an analyst use less than two minutes per day to identify new CVEs.

Please note that it is important to fill out the assets database properly for the matching to be performed.
